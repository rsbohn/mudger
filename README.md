A musical bodge? Build something musical in five parts. A Dexter Starboard project.

Mudge is a sandy, desert-like area in the south-east corner of Oz. It's inhabitants have blue beards. 
In times before Ozma came to the throne, the Mudgers would often pillage and ransack neighboring communities in Munchkin Country.

Modern Mudgers just want to make music. With CircuitPython I guess.

## roadmap

### part 1 -- getting started

Blinking lights and making noise.

### part 2 -- make some more noise

MIDI and you. Send, receive, profit.

### part 3 -- build a sequencer

What to play, when to play it. How.

### part 4 -- ditch the computer

Playing tones and samples with CircuitPython.

### part 5 -- show your work

Add a display and some controllers. Take your show on the road!
