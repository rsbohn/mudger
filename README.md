# mudger
A musical bodge? Build something musical in five parts. A Dexter Starboard project.

Mudge is a sandy, desert-like area in the south-east corner of Oz. It's inhabitants have blue beards.
In times before Ozma came to the throne, the Mudgers would often pillage and ransack neighboring communities in Munchkin Country.

Modern Mudgers just want to make music. With CircuitPython I guess.

## roadmap

### part 1 -- getting started

Blinking lights and making noise.

Equipment: Metro M4 Express or other microcontroller board (MCU), speaker.

### part 2 -- make some more noise

MIDI and you. Send, receive, profit.

Equipment: MCU, MIDI software or synthesizer (VCV Rack).

### part 3 -- build a sequencer

What to play, when to play it. How.

Equipment: same as part 2

### part 4 -- ditch the computer

Playing tones and samples with CircuitPython.

Equipment: MCU, speaker, buttons, solderless breadboard

(Okay, you still need the computer to set things up.)

### part 5 -- show your work

Add a display and some controllers. Take your show on the road!

Equipment: MCU, speaker, buttons, solderless breadboard, OLED display, sliders and/or potentiometers.
